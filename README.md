# vscode-ocaml-reason-format

This is a dirty extension that serves as a transitional tool while support for `ocamlformat` and `refmt` is in WIP stage in proper extensions.

## Setting

`ocaml-reason-format.ocamlformat` — the path to the `ocamlformat` binary
`ocaml-reason-format.refmt` — the path to the `refmt` binary
